Tidyrisk is a collection of R packages for performing quantitative risk 
management using the [OpenFAIR](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13G) 
framework. Aspiring to the design ethos of the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) 
and [tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/) 
projects, tidyrisk helps organizations walk through the following 
steps in performing a risk analysis:

-  formulating risk scenarios
-  collecting subject matter expert (SME) opinion with calibration
-  building parameterized distributions for SME responses
-  applying opinion pooling to SME distributions to generate a consensus view
-  creating quantitative scenario data structures
-  simulating risk outcomes via Monte Carlo sampling
-  reporting on risk
