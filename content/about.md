Tidyrisk is a collection of R packages for performing quantitative risk 
management using the [OpenFAIR](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/C13G) framework. Aspiring to the design ethos of 
the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) and [tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/) 
projects, the tidyrisk packages help organizations walk through the following 
steps in performing a risk analysis:

-  formulating risk scenarios
-  collecting subject matter expert (SME) opinion with calibration
-  building parameterized distributions for SME responses
-  applying opinion pooling to SME distributions to generate a consensus view
-  creating quantitative scenario data structures
-  simulating risk outcomes via Monte Carlo sampling
-  reporting on risk

The tidyrisk packages are in active development, but are usable in 
their current form. With open development, interested users are encouraged to 
leverage these early versions and provide feedback.
